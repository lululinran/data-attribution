        "This is a webUI for [Music-Source-Separation-Training (MSST)](https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training), which is a repository for training models for music source separation. You can use this webUI to infer the MSST model and VR Models, and the preset process page allows you to customize the processing flow yourself. You can install models in the \"Install Models\" interface. If you have downloaded [Ultimate Vocal Remover (UVR)](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui) before, you do not need to download VR Models again. You can go to the \"Settings\" page and directly select your UVR5 model folder. We also provide some convenient tools in the WebUI such as [Singing-Oriented MIDI Extractor (SOME)](https://github.com/openvpi/SOME/), advanced ensemble mode, and more."
